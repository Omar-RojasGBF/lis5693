hello I'm blue and in today's video 
I'll be going over color theory  
but before I start this video is brought to you by 
the kind people over at skillshare skillshare is  
an online learning platform where you can learn 
things from photography to Art how to manage a  
career in the creative fields and finances and 
so much more skillshare is a great class that  
deep dive into the intricacy of color theory 
and color picking color palettes which are  
told by professional artists from classes like 
one poet illustrator discover how Color Works  
in your art by Tom Forest to the color Survival 
Guide by Marco Busey but these classes of unique  
perspective to use of colors there's so many 
more classes touching another subject too with  
unique perspectives and insight not just in the 
creative and physical side of learning skillshare  
also offers classes on developing and choosing 
career paths from working in the creative field  
to managing finances they have many more classes 
to further your career and help reach your goals  
it's always fun to learn new and interesting 
things whether they're just you for fun and  
hobbies or to build a career skillshare is 
offering one month free to the first thousand  
people to use the link in my description thank you 
again for the sports skillshare and now on to the  
video I had to start today's video into two parts 
one where I cover color theory and the other where  
I share how I pick colors using color theory so 
basically color theory is a collection of rules  
and guidelines that are just used to communicate 
to the viewers how well colors go together can  
affect the atmosphere of the piece colors can 
be used to guide the viewer's eyes to what is  
important in the piece to share emotions or create 
a feeling or atmosphere now the color wheel is the  
basis of color theory it is made in the thought of 
relationships between colors and how they affect  
each other here's what the color wheel looks 
like it can be found in most digital art programs  
the Outer Circle is called the Hue this is 
where you can find and select different colors  
this section over here is a saturation saturation 
is the intensity of a color here I have a very  
saturated purple but I can desaturate it and make 
it look lighter the valley is the brightness or  
darkness of the color you can change the value of 
the color by adding more black to it or selecting  
this part of the color wheel so like this now 
this purple looks a lot muddier because I have  
changed the value by adding more black to it now I 
feel like there's so much more I can explain about  
values but I would keep that for a full video 
in the future for now just the basics is good  
color saturation is actually the biggest culprit 
to color picking highly saturated colors can make  
a piece restless and have no Focus point for the 
viewer's eyes to rest on though if this is what  
you're going for 100 go for it art doesn't need 
to have a set of rules this is just what I like to  
think about when I'm like picking colors now this 
doesn't mean that highly saturated colors can't  
be used well in pieces highly set your colors 
against these saturated colors can be used for  
contrast so which draw attention to specific 
colors details objects in the views and I've  
seen a lot of people use like highly saturated 
colors in their pieces and looks very nice color  
Harmony is the colors that go well together this 
can make a viewer look or feel a certain way the  
color wheel can be used to find color harmonies 
for example yellow orange and red are colors that  
are really good together because they lie next 
to each other on the color wheel by using the  
layers of the color wheel picking colors that are 
pleasing a bowl is easier by using the rules of  
color combination color schemes or color palettes 
even if you don't have a good eye for color here  
are some color combinations or color schemes that 
look good together I'll show you this by using the  
color wheel I'll also show you where the colors 
can be located first one is complementary colors  
this is probably the one of the most popular it's 
the use of two colors opposite to each other on  
the color wheel like red and green or purple and 
orange using complementary colors can give the  
art work high contrast and can be very vibrant 
and prominent when you use a color palette don't  
use the colors equally like 50 50 have one color 
be dominant and the other be used as a highlight  
next is split complementary color scheme similar 
to the complementary color scheme this one uses  
two colors that are close to each other on the 
color wheel and then one color on the opposite  
side I make use of this one the most since I love 
the Deep contrast that the opposite color can  
bring and still be very easy on the eye because 
the colors that are next to each other that create  
Harmony following this one is my two most favorite 
Harmony is to use monochromatic and analogous  
color schemes both of these use tones and tens and 
relos all in one or two color Hues monochromatic  
uses one Hue analogous makes use of more Hues 
that are next to each other in the color wheel  
they create a peaceful and comfortable mood 
since the colors are related to each other or  
next to each other on the color wheel creating 
an adventure with these two schemes is a lot of  
fun once you learn the meaning of color 
which I'll touch on later in the video  
next is tetratic this is choosing two pairs of 
complementary colors similar to the last but  
with an extra pair of Hues added this can create 
a pleasing set of colors though it's harder to  
pull off it's in a color palette I use personally 
colors also have feelings moods and Vibes in them  
that will help communicate What atmosphere 
you're trying to convey in your art it's as  
simple as warmer colors will go with warmer and 
more aggressive emissions while colder colors go  
with more cold and calmer and sad emotions here's 
a few examples like red is associated with passion  
and danger orange is associated with energy and 
creativity yellow is associated with happy and  
Active Green is associated with nature and healing 
blue is associated with calm and wisdom purple is  
associated with wealth and ambition white is 
Purity and peace and black is death and Power  
add in these colors according to what emotion you 
would like to bring to the piece will help convey  
atmosphere I like to use the analogous color 
scheme and choose Hues that fit the piece like  
if it's sad I'll use more blues and purples but 
if I want to add a bit more of an angry element  
I'll add a warmer tint of red this will change 
if the color scheme from analogous to split  
complementary color palette now we can go to 
the bit more of a trickier side of color theory  
color context is the effect of different 
values saturation and Hues like the warm or the  
coldness of a certain color can cause noticeable 
differences and however perceive that color the  
way we see Hues and values and saturations can be 
changed by surrounding Keys values and saturations  
as it's called simultaneous contrast here for 
example the color in the middle is the same but  
the background can make these colors feel a lot 
more different than what they actually are value  
is also affected by similar to newest contrast 
when a color is placed in a dark background it  
will appear larger when the same color is placed 
in light background it will appear darker when  
a certain color is placed next to each other they 
can create an illusion of depth High Valley colors  
such as white tend to look bigger while lower 
value colors such as black tend to look smaller  
this creates the illusion of depth for example 
The White Square on the black background looks  
like it's bigger while the black Square on the 
white background looks like it's a lot smaller  
these are in fact the same size this is a more 
complicated part of color theory and it can take  
a while to really grasp this is okay I use it a 
lot when I'm laying on colors or planning up the  
valley lunar piece but I hope to cover that in the 
next video grass pink color theory is all about  
applying its tuber and to see what works with your 
art style and what doesn't okay please remember  
that there are just guidelines to help you choose 
colors and to create an atmosphere you want thank  
you so much again to school share for sponsoring 
this video and I'll see you guys in the next they
